Experiment 1: JavaScript CRUD Program
Description:
This program is a simple demonstration of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on a JavaScript array. It uses a small array of objects to simulate a list of books and performs all four core operations: adding a new book, reading the existing list, updating a book's title, and deleting a book from the lists.
