Experiment 1: JavaScript CRUD Program
Description
This program is a simple demonstration of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on a JavaScript array. It uses a small array of objects to simulate a list of books and performs all four core operations: adding a new book, reading the existing list, updating a book's title, and deleting a book from the list.

How to Run
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the exp-1 folder in your repository.
Run the program using the command: node crud.js
The output, which shows the array's state at each step, will be displayed directly in the terminal.
